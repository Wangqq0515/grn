# Maize gene regulatory network (GRN) code and data

This repository hosts code and data related to gene regulatory networks built using maize expression datasets.  [Check here](data/10.dataset.tsv) for a complete list of GRNs built for this project.

This repo also provides a collection of published maize transcription factor functional studies, with focus on Chip-Seq and knockout mutant RNA-Seq datasets. [Check here](/data/07_known_tf/tf.tsv) for detail.
